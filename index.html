    <p>This project was created to investigate the relationships between latitude<br>
       and several different metrics of weather; temperature, humidity, cloudiness<br>
       and wind speed. A list of random cities across the globe was generated and then<br>
       data was retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API, before visualization and analysis<br>
       was undertaken in a jupyter notebook using pandas and matplotlib. Links to the<br>
       visualizations, comparison page , and data can be found in the navigation bar above.</p>
