    <h1>Is There a Relationship Between Latitude & Cloudiness?</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>From this visualization it is hard to see any distinct relationship<br>
    between a places' location latitudinally and the percentage of cloud cover.<br>
    A further statistical analysis would need to be done to confirm this, but<br>
    it is just as likely to have n% of clouds far from the equator as close to it.</p>
