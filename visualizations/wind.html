    <h1>Is There a Relationship Between Latitude & Wind Speed?</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Once again, there doesn't seem to be a distinct relationship between wind speed<br>
    and latitude. The main theme one could glean from this visualization is that<br>
    there are very few places within the sample set which have high wind speeds,<br>
    at least during the day and time when the data was retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap<br>
    API. </p>
