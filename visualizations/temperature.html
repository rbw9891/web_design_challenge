    <h1>Is There a Relationship Between Latitude & Temperature?</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>As one could imagine, there is a pretty distinct relationship between temperature<br>
    and latitude. The farther one gets from the equator, the colder the temperatures and<br>
    vice versa. It is interesting to note that extreme cold temperatures are much more present<br>
    in the northern hemisphere as compared to the southern. This could have something to do<br>
    with the fact that much more of the human population lives in the north as compared to the<br>
    south and thus we have less data points for southern cities. This is also have something<br>
    to do with much larger land masses farther towards the north pole than towards the south pole.<br>
    There just aren't a lot of places extrememly south of the equator for humans to live!</p>
