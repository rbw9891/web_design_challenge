    <h1>Is There a Relationship Between Latitude & Humidity?</h1>
    <hr>

    <img src="../assets/Fig2.png", alt="Humidity">

    <p>There doesn't seem to be a distinct relationship between latitude and<br>
    humidity. On the other hand, from this visualization it is interesting to<br>
    see that there are many more humid places than dry ones from this random sample<br>
    set. A larger sample might be needed to determine if this is true. It is also<br>
    worth noting that the data points with the lowest humidity are approximately around<br>
    30 degrees latitude, which is a widely known region for containing many of the <br>
    world's largest deserts.</p>
